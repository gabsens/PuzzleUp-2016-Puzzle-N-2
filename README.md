# Comments :

`k` is the number of balls you're drawing from the urn.

`trials` is how often you repeat the experiment.

`prob` is the simulated probability of getting at least 2 consecutive numbers among the sampled balls.

The theoretical probability is **1 - Binomial[100 - k + 1, k]/Binomial[100, k]**
